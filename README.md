#Overview of the School District Analysis
The strength of an education system and the resources it has are essential for student success. City school districts are responsible for analyzing data, at the student and school level, from multiple sources and in various formats, which ultimately provide insight on how well students are performing, the size of school budgets and overall priorities. For the School District Analysis project, student’s math and reading scores will be analyzed, along with information on the schools they attend. By aggregating this data, trends on school performance can be identified and utilized to implement strategic decisions at the school and district level.

#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate the math and reading grades for Thomas High School students. A key dataset utilized in evaluating the analysis, indicates that there is evidence of academic dishonesty, as the grades for ninth grade students appear to have been altered. In an effort to uphold state-testing standards, a comparative analysis will be completed which will indicate whether replacing math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth grade students with NaNs, which means ‘not a number’ and cannot be equal, will affect the overall analysis.
